2. Setup a meeting with the professor to chat about our project
3. Settle on the project
4. Starting writting up the proposal


## DATE: Mon Sept 30, 2021

### Notes
Met today to discuss what the project would entail. 

For now, we are awaiting the manuals on the SLS6502 machines.

In the meantime, some of us will be familiraizing ourselves with web assembly, and we will create a framework c file that would give a good outline of how we should implement the simulator. 

## DATE: Sun Oct 3/, 2021

### Notes

Preliminary Makefile and 6502.c file created and pushed to master. 

### Progress

For prototype of the SLS6502
CPU is a struct with fields as registers. Memory is a char pointer; an array. Main currently does the following: initializes space for memory and cpu, continually switch/case, case 0xEA -> the 'no op" case

### Goals

1. Speak with Appavoo about merging and git in general
2. Get the manuals
3. Someone needs to print hello world in web assembly
