### Notes
Met today to discuss what the project would entail. 

For now, we are awaiting the manuals on the SLS6502 machines.

In the meantime, some of us will be familiraizing ourselves with web assembly, and we will create a framework c file that would give a good outline of how we should implement the simulator.
